A US senior official says Washington has decided to stop providing Russia with information on strategic nuclear weapons, citing Moscow's failure to comply with the New START nuclear arms control treaty.White House National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby told reporters on Tuesday that Russia has not been in full compliance and refused to share biannual data. He said, "We have decided to likewise not share that data."Kirby noted that the pact is important not only for the two countries but for the world. He said that the US would prefer to be able to share information again, but Russia must show the same willingness.Last month, Russian President Vladimir Putin unilaterally declared that he would put the bilateral nuclear treaty on hold. US President Joe Biden called the move a "big mistake."The deal requires an exchange of data such as the number and locations of nuclear warheads.Experts are voicing concerns about the impact of the treaty suspension on nuclear disarmament of the two countries.
