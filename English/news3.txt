Myanmar's military-appointed election commission has announced that the political party led by Aung San Suu Kyi will be dissolved as of Wednesday.The election commission made the announcement on state media on Tuesday. It said the National League for Democracy, or NLD, will be invalidated and dissolved as it failed to meet a Tuesday deadline to re-register.The military, which seized power in a coup in 2021, enacted a new law on the registration of political parties in January.The law also requires political parties to field candidates in more than 500 constituencies in the country. The requirement made it impossible for the NLD to apply for re-registration as Aung San Suu Kyi and other NLD executives have been detained and many other party members fled overseas.The military staged a coup, claiming that there were irregularities in the 2020 general election, which the NLD won in a landslide victory.The junta claims that it will conduct a fair election upon the completion of the state of emergency, which was extended in February. But the election's significance is in question now that the military effectively eliminated pro-democracy parties from elections.
